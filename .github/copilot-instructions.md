## Quality Gates

All of the following MUST pass before marking any task complete or creating a commit:

| Gate             | Command              | Required                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript       | `pnpm typecheck`     | Zero errors                                        |
| Lint             | `pnpm lint`          | Zero warnings (`--max-warnings 0`)                 |
| Format           | `pnpm format:check`  | All files pass                                     |
| Tests + Doctests | `pnpm test`          | All pass                                           |
| Coverage         | `pnpm test:coverage` | ≥98% lines / functions / branches / statements     |

**Additional ESLint-enforced constraints**:

- All source files ≤ 150 non-comment lines (`max-lines` rule)
- JSDoc blocks contain ONLY `@example` blocks with `` ```ts @import.meta.vitest `` fences (`local/jsdoc-examples-only` rule)
- No `@ts-ignore` / `@ts-expect-error` without adjacent `@example` doctest
- No unused locals or parameters

**TDD discipline (task-level)**:

- Within each `F###` group: T001 = test (RED), T002 = implement (GREEN), T003 = refactor (BLUE, optional)
- Confirm T001 FAILS before writing T002; confirm T001 PASSES after T002
- Do NOT start the next `F###` group until the current group is GREEN
- Do NOT batch all tests into one group and all implementations into another

DO NOT commit broken code. DO NOT mark tasks complete if any gate fails.
Reference plan.md for architecture decisions. Follow Codebase Patterns in progress.md.

## Code Style

Follow the patterns established in the codebase:

- Check existing files for naming conventions
- Match indentation and formatting styles
- Use the same import/module patterns
- Follow any linting rules configured in the project

## Error Handling

| Condition                | Expected Behavior                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User story unclear       | Ask for clarification in progress entry, mark tasks as blocked                        |
| Tests fail               | Run `pnpm test` for detail. Fix the code (never suppress). Do not mark task complete. No commit. |
| Cannot complete story    | Report partial progress, commit only if all completed tasks form coherent unit        |
| All tasks done           | Commit final story, output `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`                              |
| Dependencies missing     | Note in progress file, skip to next available task                                    |
