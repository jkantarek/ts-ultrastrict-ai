# ts-ultrastrict-ai — Agent Coding Standards

This file governs how AI agents (and humans) write, test, and lint code in this repository.
All rules below are enforced by tooling; treat any conflict between this file and the
tooling configuration as a bug to fix, not a reason to relax the rule.

## Available Agents

This project ships with the full **Speckit** agent suite for structured feature development.
All agents live in `.github/agents/` and are invoked via VS Code Copilot Chat with `/`.

| Agent | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Specify | `/speckit.specify` | Convert a natural-language feature description into a structured spec |
| Clarify | `/speckit.clarify` | Ask targeted clarifying questions against an existing spec |
| Plan | `/speckit.plan` | Produce a technical implementation plan from a spec |
| Analyze | `/speckit.analyze` | Analyze the codebase in context of a spec |
| Tasks | `/speckit.tasks` | Break a plan into a prioritized, ordered task list |
| Implement | `/speckit.implement` | Execute tasks from tasks.md one at a time |
| Checklist | `/speckit.checklist` | Generate and run quality checklists |
| Constitution | `/speckit.constitution` | Generate or update the project's coding constitution |
| Git: Initialize | `/speckit.git.initialize` | Set up git and initial commit |
| Git: Feature | `/speckit.git.feature` | Create a feature branch |
| Git: Commit | `/speckit.git.commit` | Stage and commit with a conventional commit message |
| Git: Remote | `/speckit.git.remote` | Push to and configure a remote |
| Git: Validate | `/speckit.git.validate` | Validate git state before merging |
| Tasks → Issues | `/speckit.taskstoissues` | Convert tasks.md entries into GitHub Issues |
| Ralph: Run | `/speckit.ralph.run` | Launch the autonomous Ralph implementation loop |
| Ralph: Iterate | `/speckit.ralph.iterate` | Run a single Ralph iteration step |

### Recommended Workflow

```
/speckit.specify  →  /speckit.plan  →  /speckit.tasks  →  /speckit.implement
```

For fully autonomous implementation after tasks are defined:

```
/speckit.ralph.run
```

## Project Bootstrap

When starting a new project from this template:

1. Run `script/bootstrap` — installs deps, sets up git hooks, and verifies all quality gates
2. Use `/speckit.git.initialize` to set up your initial commit
3. Use `/speckit.git.remote` to push to a remote repository

---

## Scripts (scripts-to-rule-them-all)

All day-to-day operations are available as executable scripts in `script/`.
Every script responds to `-h` / `--help` for full usage details.

| Script | Purpose | Key flags |
|---|---|---|
| `script/bootstrap` | First-time setup: install deps, hooks, verify all gates | |
| `script/test` | Run the test suite | `--coverage`, `--watch`, `--ui` |
| `script/lint` | Typecheck + ESLint + Prettier check | `--fix` |
| `script/server` | Start the development server | |
| `script/console` | Launch an interactive REPL | `--tsx` for TypeScript REPL |
| `script/update` | Update dependencies and re-verify gates | `--latest`, `--interactive` |
| `script/ci` | Run the full CI gate suite locally | `--no-color` |

**`script/ci` is the canonical pre-push check.** It mirrors `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exactly — if it passes locally, CI will pass.

When instructed to verify the project is in a healthy state, always prefer `script/ci` over running individual `pnpm` commands.

## File Construction

### Size limit: 150 non-comment source lines

ESLint enforces `max-lines: 150` (comments and blank lines excluded).
A file that approaches or exceeds this limit is a signal to apply Domain-Driven Design:

- Identify the distinct responsibilities inside the file.
- Extract each responsibility into its own module under a domain-named subdirectory
  (e.g. `src/auth/`, `src/api/`, `src/utils/`).
- The entry file for each domain should re-export the public API; internals stay private.
- Do **not** split a file arbitrarily — split along cohesive domain boundaries only.

### One public concern per file

A source file should have a single, named purpose. Avoid "utils catch-all" files; if a
utility doesn't belong to a domain, reconsider the domain model.

### TypeScript strictness

All code must satisfy the compiler options in `tsconfig.src.json`:

- `strict`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noImplicitOverride`, and `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`
  are all enabled.
- No `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error` suppressions without an accompanying
  `@example` doctest that demonstrates why the suppression is unavoidable.

---

## Documentation

### Executable doctests only — no prose JSDoc

The custom ESLint rule `local/jsdoc-examples-only` is set to `error`.
Every JSDoc block **must** consist solely of `@example` blocks that contain a
`` ```ts @import.meta.vitest `` fence. These blocks are executed as live tests by
`vite-plugin-doctest` on every `vitest run`.

**Correct:**
```ts
/**
 * @example
 * ```ts @import.meta.vitest
 * expect(clamp(5, 0, 10)).toBe(5);
 * expect(clamp(-1, 0, 10)).toBe(0);
 * ```
 */
export function clamp(value: number, min: number, max: number): number { … }
```

**Forbidden:** `@param`, `@returns`, `@description`, or any plain prose in JSDoc.

---

## Testing

### Philosophy: black-box, functional, no mocks

- Tests must exercise the **public API** of a module, not its internals.
- **No mocking.** A test that requires a mock is a symptom of improperly structured
  code — the dependency should be injected, isolated into its own unit, or the design
  should be reconsidered. Fix the design rather than add a mock.
- Tests must not import or reference private symbols (anything not exported).

### Two complementary layers

| Layer | Location | Runner |
|---|---|---|
| Inline doctests | `@example @import.meta.vitest` blocks in source files | `vite-plugin-doctest` via `includeSource` |
| Black-box unit / integration tests | `src/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}` alongside source | Vitest `include` |

Both layers run on every `vitest run` invocation.

### Coverage target: 98%+

Thresholds enforced in `vitest.config.ts`:

```
lines:      98
functions:  98
branches:   98
statements: 98
```

A coverage miss is **not** acceptable technical debt — it is a refactoring signal:

- Uncovered line → the path is unreachable or the public API does not expose it; simplify or remove it.
- Uncovered branch → conditional logic is not testable through the public API; extract it into a pure function.
- Uncovered function → the function may be dead code or not yet integrated; decide and act.

### Test file conventions

- Named `<subject>.test.ts`, co-located with the source file.
- Import only from the public export of the module under test.
- Use `describe` / `it` with plain English names that read as specifications.
- No `beforeEach` / `afterEach` setup that hides state — prefer pure functions and
  explicit data construction in each `it` block.

## Linting & Formatting

### ESLint — zero warnings allowed

`eslint . --max-warnings 0` must pass. Rules of note:

| Rule | Setting |
|---|---|
| `@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type` | `error` |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` | `error` |
| `@typescript-eslint/prefer-readonly` | `error` |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises` | `error` |
| `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-imports` | `error` — use `import type` |
| `no-console` | `warn` (only `console.warn` / `console.error` permitted) |
| `max-lines` | `error` at 150 (skip comments) |
| `local/jsdoc-examples-only` | `error` |

### Naming conventions (enforced)

| Symbol | Format |
|---|---|
| Interface, TypeAlias, Enum | `PascalCase` |
| EnumMember | `UPPER_CASE` |
| Variable | `camelCase`, `UPPER_CASE`, or `PascalCase` |
| Function | `camelCase` or `PascalCase` |
| Class | `PascalCase` |

### Prettier

All files formatted by Prettier (`prettier --check` must pass).
`.github/` is excluded in `.prettierignore` and must stay excluded.

### Pre-commit gate (lint-staged + husky)

The commit hook runs:
- `prettier --check` on `*.{ts,tsx,json,md,html,css}`
- `eslint --max-warnings 0` on `*.{ts,tsx}`

Do not bypass with `--no-verify`. Fix the root cause.

---

## Quality Gates (summary)

All of the following MUST pass before marking any task complete or creating a commit:

| Gate | Command | Required |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | `pnpm typecheck` | Zero errors |
| Lint | `pnpm lint` | Zero warnings |
| Format | `pnpm format:check` | All files pass |
| Tests + Doctests | `pnpm test` | All pass |
| Coverage | `pnpm test:coverage` | ≥98% on all metrics |

### TDD discipline

- T001 = write a failing test (RED)
- T002 = write implementation to make it pass (GREEN)
- T003 = refactor while keeping tests green (BLUE, optional)
- Confirm T001 FAILS before writing T002
- Confirm T001 PASSES after T002

---

## Domain-Driven Refactoring Triggers

When any of the following occur, pause and refactor before adding more code:

1. A file is at or above 130 non-comment lines (buffer before the 150 hard limit).
2. A test requires a mock or spy on an internal dependency.
3. Coverage drops below 98% on any metric.
4. A single file exports more than one clearly distinct concern.
5. A `@example` doctest block grows beyond ~10 assertions (extract a `.test.ts`).

Refactoring means extracting to a new domain module with its own tests — not moving
code into a generic utility file.
